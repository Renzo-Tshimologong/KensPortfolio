            <p>From 1961 to the debut of Superstar Ken in 1977 Ken had straight arms that didn't bend. His head could
                only turn left and right. Ken's hair was made of felt in his first year (known to collectors as the
                "flocked" hair Ken), but this was replaced with a plastic, molded hairstyle when the creators realized
                that the felt hair fell off when wet.[3] Superstar Ken featured a dimpled smile, a head that could
                swivel, bent arms, a more muscular physique, jewelry, and underwear permanently molded to his body. The
                woman who made the Ken doll made it to resemble her husband.

                Spy glasses are usually unisex frames with a video camera embedded at eye level, generally between the
                lenses, for hands-free recording. An accompanying microphone can pick up sounds several feet away. There
                are no exposed switches to start or stop the camera which ensures that the recording takes place without
                arousing suspicion.<br />

                The idea of computational intelligence may come from observing the behavior of creatures. ACO was
                presented by studying the behavior of ants, and PSO was presented by
                examining the movements of flocking gulls. Through inspecting the behavior of the cat,
                Cat Swarm Optimization (CSO) is proposed. The artificial structure can be viewed as the
                model for modeling the common behavior of cats. CSO somehow belongs to
                the swarm intelligence. PSO with a weighting factor [11] usually finds the optimal solution
                faster than the others [10], but the proposed CSO may give much better performance than
                PSO with a weighting factor. This paper considers the extended results of the previous
                work of the conference paper [17] by adding further descriptions and experiments.

                Cloning is a technique scientists use to make exact genetic copies of living things. Genes, cells,
                tissues, and even whole animals can all be cloned.

                Some clones already exist in nature. Single-celled organisms like bacteria make exact copies of
                themselves each time they reproduce. In humans, identical twins are similar to clones. They share almost
                the exact same genes. Identical twins are created when a fertilized egg splits in two.

                Scientists also make clones in the lab. They often clone genes in order to study and better understand
                them. To clone a gene, researchers take DNA from a living creature and insert it into a carrier like
                bacteria or yeast. Every time that carrier reproduces, a new copy of the gene is made.<br />
